<!-- This is an example Django template -->

<!-- First we use another template as a base. -->
{% extends "base.html" %}

<!-- Then we tell Django we'll be using static files -->
{% load static %}

<!-- The base templates has "blocks" in which we insert our content. Here we tell Django that the following content
     should be in the "content section" -->
{% block content %}

<!-- The content section is just what is inside the <body> tag, but we can use Django templating language
     In this case, a variable called "username" is passed to the template engine, and we render it thus: -->
<main class="layout-fill container landing-message">
	<p>Create 2d games with python using Pygame, a simple and intuitive game library</p>
	<!-- And here is an example of a static image: -->
	<img src="{% static "images/python.jpg" %}">
</main>

{% endblock %}

<!-- That's it! This is just a very simple example. -->
